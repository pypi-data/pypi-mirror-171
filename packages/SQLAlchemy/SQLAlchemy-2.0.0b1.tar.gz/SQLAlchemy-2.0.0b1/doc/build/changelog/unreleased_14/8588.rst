    Adjusted the regular expression used to match "CREATE VIEW" when
    testing for views to work more flexibly, no longer requiring the
    special keyword "ALGORITHM" in the middle, which was intended to be
    optional but was not working correctly.  The change allows view reflection
    to work more completely on MySQL-compatible variants such as StarRocks.
