# Webster

Webster is an experimental python web scraping framework for my own learning.

Webster can be used to scrape or download webpages by giving a list of urls to visit and
optionally a list of urls to stay within.

Webster could be used as a broad crawler also, but it is not optimized for that as of now.

## Version
Webster has been tested using Python 3.10+

## Project documentation
1. [Quick start guide](docs/project_docs/quickstart.md)
2. [Architectural model](docs/project_docs/architecture.md)
3. [Functional specification](docs/project_docs/functional_spec.md)
4. [Test documentation](docs/project_docs/testing.md)


## Installation
Install Webster using one off the following methods

From requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Dependencies
Webster is using multiple external Python packages some of which are:
+ [lxml](https://lxml.de/index.html) used for processing html documents.
+ [w3lib](https://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) used for URL handling and prosessing.
+ [pycURL](http://pycurl.io/) used for networking and making requests to a http server.
+ [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tools for working with mongoDB using python

Use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to make new requirements.txt
if new dependencies are added in PR force over requirements.txt
and make sure to include the new one in PR.

```bash
pipreqs --force
```

Update dependencies if necessary

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing
Webster uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for testing.

To run all the tests use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -v
```

Example: We want to test Parser module
To run single module test use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test.test_parser -v
```


### Coverage
To run test coverage use the [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.5.0/) module

```bash
python -m coverage run -m unittest
```

To show coverage report in terminal

```bash
python -m coverage report
```

Output should look something like this.

```console

```bash
python -m coverage html

open htmlcov/index.html   
```
