kmthachner is a Python-based product serve  API to create a **Local Host Server** implement **Named Entity Recognition** task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Models are trained on [CONLL-2003 Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003) with using soft models (<4MB).

The pipepline of models is based on papers listed in Documention directory.

For building models, I use [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - An open-source **machine learning framework** developed by [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/).

Back-end is built based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - A Modern Web Framework For Production.

## Models Evaluation Results
**API's Models are trained with hyperparameters:**

Total Epochs: 30

Batch Size: 32

Learning Rate: 0.001

Gradient Clipping: 15.0

Dropout: 0.5

**Then evaluate models on Test Dataset use F1, Precision, Recall as metrics.**

## Install kmthachner

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install kmthachner.

``` bash
pip install kmthachner
```

## Usage

### For Initialize a Server
```python
from kmthachner.api import server
model_mode = 5 # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
device_mode = 0 # [0, 1]
server.start(model_mode, device_mode)
```
After runing the above code, if module start server successfully, you will get some logs like this:
```log
INFO:     Started server process [19172]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Then, open the local host address ( Example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs#/default) in your browser to test the server.

Finally, click Execute to get the predictions:

![Step 3](images/step3.png)
### For Make Predictions
```python
from kmthachner.api import predictor
model_mode = 5 # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
device_mode = 0 # [0, 1]
my_predictor = predictor.Predictor(model_mode, device_mode)
sequences = ['Barack Obama is the first president of the US', 'Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of Facebook']
my_predictor.predict(sequences)
```
**Parameters:**

model_mode: an integer in [0:6] (Default is 5) is the type of model to use. At present, we support models as table given below.

device_mode: 0 or 1 (Default is 1) is setting the using the device to CPU (0) or GPU (1).

port: an integer for port (Default is 5000).
