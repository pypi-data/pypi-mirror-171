# Welcome to DEV_KIT
Welcome to the DEV_KIT module!
This module is a compilation of methods for working developers.
Open this module file and check it to see what the code is!

# Hmm...
I don't know what the code is because it's from someone else's blog...
 I'll put the code as it is in the code description, so please take a look and tell me!

# update log
This is where you write down the changes for each version.
