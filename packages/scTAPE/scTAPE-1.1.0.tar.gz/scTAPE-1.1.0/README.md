**This model is able to accurately deconvolve bulk RNA-seq data into cell fractions and predict cell-type-specific gene expression at cell-type level based on scRNA-seq data**.

## Warning
The data I uploaded to the tsinghua cloud is not stable and maybe removed in the future since I left Tsinghua University. If you need these files, please contact me (poseidonchan@icloud.com).

## Setup

TAPE uses PyTorch as its Deep-learning framework, so the suitable version of PyTorch will accelerate the model training process. We recommend users to install PyTorch(>=1.8.0) with ***right*** compute platform (CUDA, CPU or ROCm) from its official [website](https://pytorch.org) in advance.

For example, we used NVIDIA GPU RTX 3090, so we choose the CUDA version 11.1 and the command is:

```bash
pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 torchvision==0.9.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.8.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

If PyTorch is successfully installed, then TAPE could be installed from PyPI directly:

```bash
pip install scTAPE
```
Usually, the installation time depends on your downloading speed.
## Usage

Required Files:
1. single-cell reference: txt format, indices are cell types, columns are gene names
2. bulk data: tabular format, needed to specify the seperation ('\t',','or others), indices are sample names, columns are gene names
3. gene length file: used to scale the expression value, columns should contain: [Gene name, Transcript start (bp), Transcript end (bp)]. This is provided in ./data/ directory.

***Warning: single-cell reference and bulk samples should contain the same cell types***

```python
# basic example
from TAPE import Deconvolution
SignatureMatrix, CellFractionPrediction = \
    Deconvolution(sc_ref, bulkdata, sep='\t',
                  datatype='counts', genelenfile='./GeneLength.txt',
                  mode='overall', adaptive=True, variance_threshold=0.98,
                  save_model_name=None,
                  batch_size=128, epochs=128, seed=1)
```
parameters:

1. datatype: use '**TPM**', '**FPKM**' or '**counts**'. Users can choose different normalization method based on your single-cell seq technique, if single-cell data is from 10X Genomics, users should use '**counts**' to maintain a resonable procedure. The explanation could be found from the [webpage](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003684783-Should-I-calculate-TPM-RPKM-or-FPKM-instead-of-counts-for-10x-Genomics-data-).
2. mode: '**overall**' or '**high-resolution**'. If you need signature matrix for each sample, use 'high-resolution' mode.
3. adaptive: **True** or **False**. If this is False, then it would not predict signature matrix, the return will be ***None***
4. variance_threshold: Float number from 0 to 1, it means how many genes you want to keep according to variance from high to low.
5. batch_size: **int**, related to training result. 32-128 are recommended. Smaller batch_size leads to more time consumption.
6. epochs: **int**, related to training result. Typically, *5000-10000* iterations are enough for TAPE, the relation is $epochs=\frac{iteration \times batch\_size}{sampleing\_num}$
7. seed: now, TAPE supports pinning the random seed to make results reproducible.

Since the original implementation of Scaden [[repository](https://github.com/KevinMenden/scaden)] [[paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba2619)] is not easy for us to test, we implemented the PyTorch version of Scaden. If you want to use Scaden to deconvolve bulk RNA-seq data, you can use the following code:

```python
from TAPE.deconvolution import ScadenDeconvolution
Pred = ScadenDeconvolution(sc_ref, bulkdata, sep='\t',
                           batch_size=128, epochs=128)
```

The parameters in this function are the same as the parameters in the *Deconvolution* function. 


## Example
An example is placed in the **Test** directory. Please run the example to get familiar with TAPE.

Run the demo may takes 2 to 3 mins with GPU acceleration or 10 mins with CPU.

## Issues
If you find any bugs or have problems when you are using scTAPE, feel free to raise issues.
