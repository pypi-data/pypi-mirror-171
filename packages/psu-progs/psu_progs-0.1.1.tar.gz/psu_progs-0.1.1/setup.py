If not specified,\n                                 this defaults to half the battery_capacity.\n  --charge-voltage FLOAT         Voltage to use while in constant-voltage\n                                 phase. For Li-ion cells, this value should be\n                                 â‰¤4.2.  [default: 4.2]\n  --charge-cutoff-ratio FLOAT    Ratio of the charge_current used to derive\n                                 the value of measured output current at which\n                                 to stop charging.

Using a value\n                                 over 1 is recommended, as anomalous blips may\n                                 be measured. This also addresses low readings\n                                 when output is first enabled.

To get started hacking around the codebase:\n\n1. Create a new virtualenv (or skip this step and let poetry do it for you)\n2. `pip install poetry`\n3. `poetry install`\n4. Good luck!\n\n# Contributing\nIf you have other utilities you'd like to add, or other PSUs you'd like to support, pull requests are welcomed! I may not be able to physically test all contributions, but I sure can review and merge :)\n",
