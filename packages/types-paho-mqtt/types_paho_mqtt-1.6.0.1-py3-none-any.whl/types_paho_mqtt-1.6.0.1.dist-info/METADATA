## Typing stubs for paho-mqtt

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `paho-mqtt` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `paho-mqtt`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/paho-mqtt. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `51e18a860129b792123a088467a431cd044b2769`.
