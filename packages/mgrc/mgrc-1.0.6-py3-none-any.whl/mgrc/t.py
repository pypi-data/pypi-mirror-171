#INSTRUCTIONS
#Edit t.py
#Description - TO EDIT T.PY FOR USER PER ELAPSE DURATION FUNCTION CALL, AS FOLLOWS:
#seconds
#To edit ds() to call your function per second, see, below:  "def call_f_2():..."
#minutes
#To edit dm() to call your function per second, see, below:  "def call_fn_2():..."
#To edit dm() to call your function per minute, see, below:  "def call_fn_3():..."
#hours
#To edit dh() to call your function per second, see, below:  "def call_fx_2():..."
#To edit dh() to call your function per minute, see, below:  "def call_fx_3():..."
#To edit dh() to call your function per hour, see, below:    "def call_fx_4():..."
