    A warning is emitted in ORM configurations when an explicit
    :func:`_orm.remote` annotation is applied to columns that are local to the
    immediate mapped class, when the referenced class does not include any of
    the same table columns. Ideally this would raise an error at some point as
    it's not correct from a mapping point of view.
