## Summary and details
---
This library makes use of ***MoviePy*** (not the one I have in my github, it is another library intended to work with video files). The main idea of this project is that you can convert your video files in a considerably easy way. Convert your entire **folders** or **video files** with ***ConvTool***. In the future I will be creating a version that supports many more formats and even a graphical interface.

- Python Version: **3.10**
- Pip Version: **The Lastest version**
- MoviePy Version: **1.0.3**





## Functions
---

#### - conv_video(route, convert_to, folder, delete_original)
> Convert your video files, or an ENTIRE folder with video files to a different format!
>

- ***Parameters:*** 
    
    - route: **string** | Path of your file or folder to convert!

    - convert_to: **string** | Format you want to convert the files to.

    - folder: **boolean** | If you want to convert a folder with video files, this has to be set to True. 

    - delete_original: **boolean** | If you want that when converting the file to the desired format, the original file is completely deleted, you should leave this parameter to True.


## Use
---

#### Installation:
To use this package, the best idea is to do it through ***pip***:
```bash
pip install ConvTool
```
***IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE "C" AND THE "T" ARE CAPITALIZED.***


Or, on the contrary, you can **clone** this repository and access it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/ConvTool
```

This will create a folder of the project itself inside your python root project. Next we have to install the necessary dependencies for the project to work correctly, this can be done with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

This would **ideally** have to install all the necessary libraries for you. This will be installed in the ***virtual environment*** of your project. See how to create a [virtual environment here]('https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html').


#### Use:

To ***import*** and use any **module**, do it as follows (if you **cloned** the repository, ***make sure*** it is in the root of your **project**):
```python
from ConvTool.ConvTool import conv_video
```

And with that done, start using it as follows:

```python
conv = conv_video(folder = False, convert_to = 'mp4', delete_original = True, route = r'miruta/archivo.mov')
```

*Now run!*
