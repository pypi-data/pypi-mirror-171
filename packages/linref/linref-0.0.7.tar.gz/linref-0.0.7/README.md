# Overview
Module featuring EventsCollection object class for the management of linearly referenced data and optimized performance of various simple and complex events and geospatial operations.

# Version Notes
## 0.0.7 (2022-10-14)
- Refactoring of EventsMerge system from 2D to 3D vectorized relationships for improved performance and accuracy. API and aggregation methods are largely the same.
- Modified closed parameter use in merge relationships in accordance with rangel v0.0.6, which now performs intersections which honor the closed parameter on the left collection as well as the right collection. This provides more accurate results for events which fall on the edges of intersecting events when using left_mod or right_mod closed parameters.
- Updates to account for rangel 0.0.6 version which is now a minimum version requirement. Added other minimum version requirements for related packages.
- Performance improvements
- Various bug fixes, minor features
