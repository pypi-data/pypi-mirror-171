# build a python package

This example repo:

- uses build, setuptools and pyproject.toml to build package
- uses setup.py to build package
- uses twine to upload package
- uses pip or setup.py to install package

```sh
pyenv shell 3.9.7
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip build wheel setuptools twine
```

## use native build

build with pyproject.toml

```sh
rm -rf build dist *.egg-info
python -m build
```

## upload to PyPI

First, register PyPI account if not yet.

Upload to package index PyPI using twine:

```sh
# optional: --skip-existing
python -m twine upload --skip-existing dist/*

Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/

```

Alternatively, PyPI supports api token to replace interactive user credentials.
First, get API token from pypi.org, then assign it to env var `TWINE_USERNAME`.

```sh
TWINE_USERNAME=token TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-XXX... python -m twine upload --skip-existing dist/*
```

Replace env var setting with $HOME/.pypirc:

```
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-XXX...
```

## use setuptools and setup.py

`python setup.py sdist` generates source distribution:

- dist folder that contains `<package-name>-<version>.tar.gz`
- <package-name>.egg-info folder

A source distribution contains source code.
That includes not only Python code but also the source code of any extension
modules (usually in C or C++) bundled with the package.
With source distributions, extension modules are compiled on the user’s side
rather than the developer’s.

Source distributions also contain a bundle of metadata sitting in a directory
called `<package-name>.egg-info`. Egg distribution format is being replaced
by wheel distribution format.

## bdist and bdist_wheel

`bdist` means build distribution, which is not necessarily binary.

`python setup.py bdist` generates:

- dist/<package-name>-<version>.<platform>.tar.gz, which is the default
  type of built distribution for the current platform
- build/bdist.<platform>
- build/lib folder that includes modules

`python setup.py bdist_wheel` generates:

- dist/<package-name>-<version>-<python>-<platform>.whl

A wheel file is essentially a zip archive with metadata of supported python
versions and platforms.

Usually only source and wheel distributions should be generated and
uploaded to package index (PyPI) for download and install.

```sh
rm -rf build dist *.egg-info
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

upload package to PyPI (First, register PyPI account if not yet.):

```sh
python -m twine upload --skip-existing dist/*
```

## install

`pip install <package-name>` is a general way of installing package.
pip always prefers wheel distribution over source distribution.
If wheel distribution is available for the target platform, source distribution
will be used to build package at client side.

To install from local, for example, the package project folder,
`pip install .` installs the package from current folder.

Local install is handy for development mode, where -e/--editable flag is 
enabled to instruct python to track change in target package project folder:
`pip install --editable .`.

pip install on wheel skips setup.py execution, if wheel is not available, 
pip has to:
- download the source distribution and extract it
- run `python setup.py install` on the extracted folder to build and install

Inside package folder, use --editable flag for development mode:
`python setup.py install --editable .`.

## pyproject.toml

A later [PEP517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) standard defines
`pyproject.toml` as the new standard for packaging and distributing python
modules.

If there's no `pyproject.toml` available, setuptools will fall back to
`setup.py` file.
