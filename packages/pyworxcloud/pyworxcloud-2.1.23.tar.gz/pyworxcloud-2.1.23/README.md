# pyWorxCloud

This is a PyPI module for communicating with Worx Cloud mowers, primarily developed for use with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), but I try to keep it as widely usable as possible.<br/>
<br/>
The module are compatible with cloud enabled devices from [these vendors](https://github.com/MTrab/pyworxcloud/wiki#current-supported-brands--vendors)

The module was developed without API documentation - this have been made accessible to me, so future versions will be adapted to correctly use the API for better functionality.

## Documentation

The documentation have been moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/MTrab/pyworxcloud/wiki)
