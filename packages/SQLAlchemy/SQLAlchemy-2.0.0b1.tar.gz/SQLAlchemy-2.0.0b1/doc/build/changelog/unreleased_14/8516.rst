    Improved implementation of ``asyncio.shield()`` used in context managers as
    added in :ticket:`8145`, such that the "close" operation is enclosed within
    an ``asyncio.Task`` which is then strongly referenced as the operation
    proceeds. This is per Python documentation indicating that the task is
    otherwise not strongly referenced.
