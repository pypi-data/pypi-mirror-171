About the Author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Very sorry, my English is not pretty good because i am just a middle
school sutdent in Shanghai,China.

I was playing the game “diaosigui” (or called “HangMan”) with my
classmates when suddenlyI had an inspiration – Why not put it into
python!

It is easy for me to do, and I completed it in 10 minutes. All I need to
do is to wait then.

--------------

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

It is very easy. First, use\ ``pip install diaosigui``\ to get the
package. Second, import it. Third, use it:``dsg.diaosigui()``. "No
argument" is allowed.

Copy the code if you are idle.

.. code:: python

   import diaosigui as dsg
   try:
       dsg.diaosigui(use_windows=True, ans='Any word you want...')
   except:
       print("There must be sth. wrong with the installation")

Easy, right?
