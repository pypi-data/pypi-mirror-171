## Node Dependencies

- `jssupport.jsjson.AstLoader` needn't outside processes.
- To use `jssupport.execjs` and `jssupport.jsjson.NodeLoader`, you need to have `Node.js` >= v14 installed.
- To use  `jssupport.jsdom`, you need to have npm packages `jsdom` and `canvas` to be installed.
- Since `canvas` is used during passing captcha, you may need to config your font config properly. See [#45](https://github.com/aioqzone/aioqzone/issues/45) for details.
