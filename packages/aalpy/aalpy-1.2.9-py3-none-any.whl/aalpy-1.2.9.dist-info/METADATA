<hr />

AALpy is a light-weight active automata learning library written in pure Python. 
You can start learning automata in just a few lines of code. 

Whether you work with regular languages or you would like to learn models of 
(black-box) reactive systems, AALpy supports a wide range of modeling formalisms, including 
**deterministic**, **non-deterministic**, and **stochastic automata**. 

<div align="center">

</div>

<!---
You can use it to learn **deterministic finite automata**, **Moore machines**, 
and **Mealy machines** of deterministic systems. 
If the system that you would like to learn shows non-deterministic or
stochastic behavior, AALpy allows you to learn **observable
nondeterministic finite-state machines**, **Markov decision processes**, 
or **stochastic Mealy machines**.

Finally, support for learning **abstracted non-deterministic Mealy machines** 
enables efficient learning of system models with large input space.
--->

AALpy enables efficient learning by providing a **large set of equivalence oracles**, implementing various conformance testing strategies. Learning 
is mostly based on Angluin's [L* algorithm](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/teaching/s10/papers/angluin87.pdf), for which AALpy supports a 
selection of optimizations, including **efficient counterexample processing** and **caching**.

AALpy also includes **passive automata learning algorithms**. Unlike active algorithms which learn by interaction with the system, passive
learning algorithms construct a model based on provided data.
AALpy includes an implementation of RPNI, a  passive deterministic automata learning algorithm that constructs a model that conforms to the
provided data.
AALpy also has an efficient implementation of the [ALERGIA](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-016-5565-9) algorithm, 
suited for passive learning of Markov Chains, Markov Decision processes, and Stochastic Mealy Machines.
For more efficient ALERGIA execution, AALpy offers bindings to [jAlergia](https://github.com/emuskardin/jAlergia), 
a Java twin of AALpy's ALERGIA code.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install AALpy.
```bash
pip install aalpy
```
The minimum required version of Python is 3.6.  
Ensure that you have [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed and added to your path if you want to visualize models.

For manual installation, clone the master and install the following dependency.
```bash
pip install pydot
# and to install the library
python setup.py install
```

**Interactive examples** can be found in the [notebooks](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/tree/master/notebooks) folder.
If you would like to interact/change those examples in the browser, click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DES-Lab/AALpy/master). (Navigate to the _notebooks_ folder and select one notebook)

[Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py) contains many examples and it is a great starting point. 

## Usage

All automata learning procedures follow this high-level approach:
- [Define the input alphabet and system under learning (SUL)](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/SUL-Interface,-or-How-to-Learn-Your-Systems)
- [Choose the equivalence oracle](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Equivalence-Oracles)
- [Run the learning algorithm](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning)

[Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py) contains examples covering almost the whole AALpy's functionality, and it is a great starting point/reference.
[Wiki](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki) has a step-by-step guide to using AALpy and can help you understand AALpy and automata learning in general. 

<details>
  <summary>Code snipped demonstrating some of AALpy's functionalities</summary>

The following snippet demonstrates a short example in which an automaton is either [loaded](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Loading,Saving,-Syntax-and-Visualization-of-Automata) or [randomly generated](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Generation-of-Random-Automata) and then [learned](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning).
```python
from aalpy.utils import load_automaton_from_file, save_automaton_to_file, visualize_automaton, generate_random_dfa, dfa_from_state_setup
from aalpy.SULs import DfaSUL
from aalpy.oracles import RandomWalkEqOracle
from aalpy.learning_algs import run_Lstar

# load an automaton
# automaton = load_automaton_from_file('path_to_the_file.dot', automaton_type='dfa')

# or construct it from state setup
dfa_state_setup = {
    'q0': (True, {'a': 'q1', 'b': 'q2'}),
    'q1': (False, {'a': 'q0', 'b': 'q3'}),
    'q2': (False, {'a': 'q3', 'b': 'q0'}),
    'q3': (False, {'a': 'q2', 'b': 'q1'})
}

small_dfa = dfa_from_state_setup(dfa_state_setup)

# or randomly generate one
random_dfa = generate_random_dfa(alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5],num_states=20, num_accepting_states=8)
big_random_dfa = generate_random_dfa(alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5],num_states=2000, num_accepting_states=500)

# get input alphabet of the automaton
alphabet = random_dfa.get_input_alphabet()

# loaded or randomly generated automata are considered as BLACK-BOX that is queried
# learning algorithm has no knowledge about its structure
# create a SUL instance for the automaton/system under learning
sul = DfaSUL(random_dfa)

# define the equivalence oracle
eq_oracle = RandomWalkEqOracle(alphabet, sul, num_steps=5000, reset_prob=0.09)

# start learning
learned_dfa = run_Lstar(alphabet, sul, eq_oracle, automaton_type='dfa')

# save automaton to file and visualize it
# save_automaton_to_file(learned_dfa, path='Learned_Automaton', file_type='dot')
# or
learned_dfa.save()

# visualize automaton
# visualize_automaton(learned_dfa)
learned_dfa.visualize()
# or just print its DOT representation
print(learned_dfa)
```

</details>

To make experiments reproducible, define a random seed at the beginning of your program.
```Python
from random import seed
seed(2) # all experiments will be reproducible
```
