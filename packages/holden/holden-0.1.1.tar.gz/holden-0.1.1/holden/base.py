Contents:
    Graph (amos.Bunch, Protocol): base class for composite data structures. 
        Provides some common functionality and requires subclass methods.
    Edge (Sequence): base class for an edge in a graph. Many graphs will not
        require edge instances, but the class is made available for more complex 
        graphs and type checking.
    # Node (amos.Proxy): wrapper for items that can be stored in a Graph or other
    #     data structure.  
    # Nodes (amos.Bunch): any collection of Node instances. This is primarily
    #     intended for easy type checking of any arbitrary group of objects to 
    #     make sure they meet the requirements of being a Node (real or virtual) 
    #     instance.
