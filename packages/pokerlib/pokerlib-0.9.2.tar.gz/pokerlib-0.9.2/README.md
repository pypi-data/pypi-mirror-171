# pokerlib
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pokerlib.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pokerlib)

## General
A lightweight Python poker library that focuses on simplifying a poker game implementation
when its io is supplied. It includes modules that help with hand parsing and poker game continuation.

One application of this library was made by the PokerMessenger app,
which supplies library with io in the form of messenger group threads.
The app's repo is at https://github.com/kuco23/pokermessenger.

## Usage
Library consists of a module for parsing cards, which can be used seperately, and modules 
that aid in running a poker game.

### HandParser
This module helps with parsing hands. A hand usually consists of 2 dealt cards plus 5 on the board, 
and `HandParser` is optimized to work with up to 7 cards (otherwise flushes and straights 
require some small additional work). A card is defined as a pair of two enums. 
All of the enums used are of `IntEnum` type, so you can also freely interchange them for integers. 
Below is an example of how to construct two different hands and then compare them.

```python
hand1 = HandParser([
    (Rank.KING, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.ACE, Suit.SPADE)
])

hand2 = HandParser([
    (Rank.NINE, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.TWO, Suit.CLUB)
])

board = [
    (Rank.EIGHT, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.TEN, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.JACK, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.QUEEN, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.TWO, Suit.HEART)
]

# This is the same as adding the cards 
# in the HandParser constructor
hand1 += board # add the board to hand1
hand2 += board # add the board to hand2

hand1.parse()
hand2.parse()

print(hand1.handenum) # Hand.STRAIGHTFLUSH
print(hand2.handenum) # Hand.STRAIGHTFLUSH
print(hand1 > hand2) # True
```

It is also possible to fetch hand's kickers.

```python
hand = HandParser([
    (Rank.TWO, Suit.DIAMOND),
    (Rank.ACE, Suit.CLUB),
    (Rank.TWO, Suit.SPADE),
    (Rank.THREE, Suit.DIAMOND),
    (Rank.TEN, Suit.HEART),
    (Rank.SIX, Suit.HEART),
    (Rank.KING, Suit.CLUB)
])

hand.parse()
print(list(hand.kickercards))
# [
#   (<Rank.ACE: 12>, <Suit.CLUB: 1>),
#   (<Rank.KING: 11>, <Suit.CLUB: 1>),
#   (<Rank.TEN: 8>, <Suit.HEART: 3>)
# ]
```

Note that `kickers` attribute saves the indices of `hand.cards` that form `kickercards`.

An important functionality of poker libraries is that they can estimate the probability
of a hand winning in a certain context (as implemented [here](https://github.com/cookpete/poker-odds)).
This is done by repeatedly random-sampling hands and then averaging the wins.
Mathematically, this process converges to the probability by the law of large numbers.

```python
from random import sample
from itertools import product
from pokerlib import HandParser
from pokerlib.enums import Rank, Suit

def getWinningProbabilities(players_cards, board=[], n=1000):
    cards = list(product(Rank, Suit))
    for player_cards in players_cards:
        for card in player_cards:
            cards.remove(card)

    wins = [0] * len(players_cards)
    for i in range(n):
        board_ = sample(cards, 5-len(board))
        hands = [
            HandParser(player_cards + board + board_)
            for player_cards in players_cards
        ]
        for hand in hands: hand.parse()
        winner = max(hands)
        for i, hand in enumerate(hands):
            if hand == winner: wins[i] += 1

    return [win / n for win in wins]
    
w1, w2 = getWinningProbabilities([
    [(Rank.ACE, Suit.HEART), (Rank.KING, Suit.HEART)],
    [(Rank.KING, Suit.SPADE), (Rank.KING, Suit.DIAMOND)]
])
```

### Poker Game
A poker table can be established by providing its configuration.
The main idea of a poker table is that it responds with output to given input.
That output can be further customized by overriding two functions that produce it.

```python
from pokerlib import Player, PlayerGroup, Table

# just print the output
class MyTable(Table):
    def publicOut(self, out_id, **kwargs):
        print(out_id, kwargs)
    def privateOut(self, player_id, out_id, **kwargs):
        print(out_id, kwargs)

table = MyTable(
    table_id = 0
    seats = 2
    players = PlayerGroup([])
    buyin = 100
    small_blind = 5
    big_blind = 10
)
```

We could provide players above inside the list, but let's add them seperately,
as this is often the case in practice.

```python
player1 = Player(
    table_id = table.id,
    _id = 1,
    name = 'alice',
    money = table.buyin
)
player2 = Player(
    table_id = table.id,
    _id = 2,
    name = 'bob',
    money = table.buyin
)
table += [player1, player2]
```

In the raw version, communication with the `table` object is established through specified enums
(this can be changed by overriding table's `publicIn` method).

```python
from pokerlib.enums import RoundPublicInId, TablePublicInId

table.publicIn(player1.id, TablePublicInId.STARTROUND)
table.publicIn(player1.id, RoundPublicInId.CALL)
table.publicIn(player2.id, RoundPublicInId.CHECK)
table.publicIn(player1.id, RoundPublicInId.CHECK)
table.publicIn(player2.id, RoundPublicInId.RAISE, raise_by=50)
table.publicIn(player1.id, RoundPublicInId.CALL)
table.publicIn(player1.id, RoundPublicInId.CHECK)
table.publicIn(player2.id, RoundPublicInId.CHECK)
table.publicIn(player1.id, RoundPublicInId.ALLIN)
table.publicIn(player2.id, RoundPublicInId.CALL)
```

Wrong inputs are mostly ignored, but can produce a response, 
when they seem to require it. As noted before, when providing input,
the `table` object responds with output ids (e.g. `PLAYERACTIONREQUIRED`)
along with additional data that depends on the output id.
For all possible outputs, check `RoundPublicInId` and `TablePublicInId` enums.

A new round has to be initiated by one of the players every time the previous one ends (or at the beginning). 
A simple command line game, where you respond by enum names, can be implemented as

```python
# define a table with fixed players, as it was done before
while table:
    while table and not table.round:
        table.publicIn(player1.id, TablePublicInId.STARTROUND)
    p = table.round.current_player
    i = input(f'Player {p.name}: ')
    cmd = RoundPublicInId.__members__[i]
    table.publicIn(p.id, cmd)
```

## Tests
Basic tests for this library are included.
For instance `round_test.py` can be started from os terminal, by typing `python round_test.py <player_num> <game_type>`, after which a simulation is run with not-that-informative data getting printed in stdout.
