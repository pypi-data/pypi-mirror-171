### Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes

[![build](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/workflows/release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core/actions/workflows/release.yml)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cdk8s.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cdk8s)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cdk8s.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cdk8s)

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

> **Note:** This repository is the "core library" of cdk8s, with logic for synthesizing Kubernetes manifests using the [constructs framework](https://github.com/aws/constructs). It is published to NPM as [`cdk8s`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk8s) and should not be confused with the cdk8s command-line tool [`cdk8s-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk8s-cli). For more general information about cdk8s, please see [cdk8s.io](https://cdk8s.io), or visit the umbrella repository located at [cdk8s-team/cdk8s](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s).

The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness. You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the ``chart.generateObjectName`` method. If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won't be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified. Default: - an app-unique name generated by the chart
        :param namespace: Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces Default: undefined (will be assigned to the 'default' namespace)
