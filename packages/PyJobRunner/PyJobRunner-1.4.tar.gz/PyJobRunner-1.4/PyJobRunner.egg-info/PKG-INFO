Description: Jobrunner
        =========
        
        Jobrunner is a minimal command line tool to manage and deploy computing jobs and organize your directories. Created because I cannot do anything without organizing it first.
        
        Examples:
        
        `Channel Flow <https://github.com/akashdhruv/channel-flow-container>`_
        
        `Nucleate Boiling <https://github.com/akashdhruv/nucleate-boiling>`_
        
        Install in development mode
        ---------------------------
        
        ::
        
           cd jobrunner
           python3 setup.py develop --user
