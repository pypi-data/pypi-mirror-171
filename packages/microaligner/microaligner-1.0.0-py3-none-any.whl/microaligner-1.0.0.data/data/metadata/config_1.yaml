# Input
# Input is a list of images, each one is a stack of channels.
# The order of channels is the same in each image,
# or at least the location of the ReferenceChannel is the same in each cycle.

Input:
  InputImagePaths:
    Cycle 1: "img_path"
    Cycle 2: "img_path2"
    Cycle 3: "img_path2"
  ReferenceCycle: 1
  ReferenceChannel: "DAPI"

# Output
# Images will be saved to a directory
#   "/path/to/out/registered_imgs"
# And because SaveOutputToCycleStack is true in this example,
# the file names will have the following patterns:
#   experiment_001_feature_reg_result_stack.tif
#   experiment_001_optflow_reg_result_stack.tif

Output:
  OutputDir: "/path/to/out/registered_imgs"
  OutputPrefix: "experiment_001_"
  SaveOutputToCycleStack: true

# Registration parameters
# Do feature based and optical flow based registration in a succession.
# For information on all the registration parameters check the file
# config_with_all_info.yaml
