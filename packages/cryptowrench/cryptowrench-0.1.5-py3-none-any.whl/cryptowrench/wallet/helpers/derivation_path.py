    # Path scheme: m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index

    #Purpose
    Purpose is a constant and it indicates the specification for which the
    subtree of this node is to be used. Hardened derivation is used at this
    level.
    
    # Coin type
    Coin type is a constant, set for each cryptocoin.

    # Account
    This level splits the key space into independent user identities, so the
    wallet never mixes the coins across different accounts.
    Accounts are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.
    Hardened derivation is used at this level.
    Software should prevent a creation of an account if a previous account does
    not have a transaction history (meaning none of its addresses have been used
    before).
    
    # Change
    Constant 0 is used for external chain and constant 1 for internal chain
    (also known as change addresses). External chain is used for addresses that
    are meant to be visible outside of the wallet (e.g. for receiving payments).
    Internal chain is used for addresses which are not meant to be visible
    outside of the wallet and is used for return transaction change.
    Public derivation is used at this level.

    # Index
    Addresses are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner. 
    Public derivation is used at this level.
