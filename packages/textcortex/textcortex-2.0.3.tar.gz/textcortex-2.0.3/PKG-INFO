### Text Generation Variables
There are some variables that you need to send before making a request to Hemingwai.

Here is a brief summary of what those variables:
```
prompt: Prompting the HemingwAI to start writing on a specific subject

temperature: Floating number between 0-1. 0 being the lowest creativity and 1 being the highest. Default is 0.7

word_count: Integer which defines the maximum amount of words that can be produced by the HemingwAI

source_language: Language code of the source language of the written prompt. for example 'en' for English and 'de' for German.
We support 72 languages. If you don't know the language code you can also use 'auto' for this field to automatically sense the input language.

Examples: For example while generating ads, you can add your target segment as an option.
See examples.py for examples.
