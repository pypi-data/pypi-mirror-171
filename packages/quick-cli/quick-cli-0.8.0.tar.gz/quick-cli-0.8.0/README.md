The Quick CLI lets you manage your Quick instance.
For more information on how to work with it, see our [user guide](https://bakdata.github.io/quick/dev/user/).

## Set up

The CLI is a Python project and you can install via pip:
```shell
pip install quick-cli
```

The first step after installing the CLI is creating a new context.
Our [user guide](https://bakdata.github.io/quick/dev/user/getting-started/setup-cli/) provides further information.

## Reference

There is a [list of all commands](https://bakdata.github.io/quick/dev/user/reference/cli-commands/) as a reference.
Additionally, you can run all commands with `-h` or `--help` to display a help message.
