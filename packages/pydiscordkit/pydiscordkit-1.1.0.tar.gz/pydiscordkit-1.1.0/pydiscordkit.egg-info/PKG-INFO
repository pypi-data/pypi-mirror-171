Description: # pydiscordkit
        
        A Discord Automation library that doesn't use the Official Discord API
        
        ## About
        Opens your browser, opens Discord, and sends the message, built for plug and play.
        
        This does not use the Discord API, using this will not lead to your account getting banned [**This cannot be guaranteed, if this project is used for malicious activities like server raiding and spam, this may lead to your acoount being terminated, otherwise you're good to go**].
        
        This project was inspired by [PyWhatKit](https://github.com/Ankit404butfound/PyWhatKit).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pydiscordkit.
        
        ```bash
        pip install pydiscordkit
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from pydiscordkit import send_dm, msg_server
        
        # send a dm
        send_dm('Your message here','958012620600934441', 120)
        # third argument is the time in seconds after which the message should be sent, 120 here means 2 minutes
        
        # send message to a server
        msg_server('Your message here','Server ID','Channel ID',120)
        # fourth argument is the time in seconds after which the message should be sent, 120 here means 2 minutes
        
        ```
        
        ## Discord Web URL 
        This section explains how the discord web url works. 
        
        ### DM channel ID
        ![CHANNELIDIMG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealcyber71/pydiscordkit/main/imgs/dmchannelid.png) \
        The number highlighted in yellow is the dm channel id.
        
        ### Server and Channel ID
        ![SERVERCHANNELIDIMG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealcyber71/pydiscordkit/main/imgs/serveridchannelid.png) 
        The number highlighted in cyan is the server id and the number highlighted in yellow is the channel id 
        
        \
        These numbers can be copy pasted as arguments for the `send_dm` and `msg_server`functions.
