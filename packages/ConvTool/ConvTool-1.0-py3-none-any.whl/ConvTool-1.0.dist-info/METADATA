## Use
---

#### Installation:
To use this package, the best idea is to do it through ***pip***:
```bash
pip install ConvTool
```
***IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE "C" AND THE "T" ARE CAPITALIZED.***


Or, on the contrary, you can **clone** this repository and access it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/ConvTool
```

This will create a folder of the project itself inside your python root project. Next we have to install the necessary dependencies for the project to work correctly, this can be done with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

This would **ideally** have to install all the necessary libraries for you. This will be installed in the ***virtual environment*** of your project. See how to create a [virtual environment here]('https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html').


#### Use:

To ***import*** and use any **module**, do it as follows (if you **cloned** the repository, ***make sure*** it is in the root of your **project**):
```python
from ConvTool.ConvTool import conv_video
```

And with that done, start using it as follows:

```python
from ConvTool.ConvTool import conv_video

conv = conv_video(folder = False, convert_to = 'mp4', delete_original = True, route = r'miruta/archivo.mov')
```

*Now run!*
