=========================
Changes in nbformat
=========================

5.7.0
=====
* Always use jsonschema to handle error reporting.
* Fix deprecation warning suggestion.

5.6.1
=====

* Fix handling of ``__version__`` on Python 3.7.

5.6.0
=====

* Fix docs and type annotations for ``validator.normalize``.
* Switch to hatch build backend.

5.5.0
=====

The  biggest change in ``nbformat`` 5.5.0 is the deprecation of arguments to
``validate()`` that try to fix notebooks errors during validation.

``validate()`` is a function that is core to the security model of Jupyter,
and is assumed in a number of places to not mutate it's argument, or try to fix
notebooks passed to it.

Auto fixing of notebook in validate can also hide subtle bugs, and will
therefore be updated in a near future to not take any of the argument related to
auto-fixing, and fail instead of silently modifying its parameters on invalid
notebooks.

``nbformat`` now contain a ``normalize`` function that will return a normalized
copy of a notebook that is suitable for validation. While offered as a convenience
we discourage its use and suggest library make sure to generate valid notebooks.

- Starting with 5.0, ``nbformat`` is now Python 3 only (>= 3.5)
- Add execution timings in code cell metadata for v4 spec.
  ``"metadata": { "execution": {...}}`` should be populated with kernel-specific
  timing information.
- Documentation for how markup is used in notebooks added
- Link to json schema docs from format page added
- Documented the editable metadata flag
- Update description for collapsed field
- Documented notebook format versions 4.0-4.3 with accurate json schema specification files

- Added a default execution_count of None for new_output_cell('execute_result')
- Added support for handling nbjson kwargs
- Wheels now correctly have a LICENSE file
- Travis builds now have a few more execution environments

4.4
===

`4.4 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestone/9>`__

- Explicitly state that metadata fields can be ignored.
- Introduce official jupyter namespace inside metadata (``metadata.jupyter``).
- Introduce ``source_hidden`` and ``outputs_hidden`` as official front-end
  metadata fields to indicate hiding source and outputs areas. **NB**: These
  fields should not be used to hide elements in exported formats.
- Fix ending the redundant storage of signatures in the signature database.
- :func:`nbformat.validate` can be set to not raise a ValidationError if
  additional properties are included.
- Fix for errors with connecting and backing up the signature database.
- Dict-like objects added to NotebookNode attributes are now transformed to be
  NotebookNode objects; transformation also works for `.update()`.


4.3
===

`4.3 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestone/7>`__

- A new pluggable ``SignatureStore`` class allows specifying different ways to
  record the signatures of trusted notebooks. The default is still an SQLite
  database. See :ref:`pluggable_signature_store` for more information.
- :func:`nbformat.read` and :func:`nbformat.write` accept file paths as bytes
  as well as unicode.
- Fix for calling :func:`nbformat.validate` on an empty dictionary.
- Fix for running the tests where the locale makes ASCII the default encoding.
- Include nbformat-schema files (v3 and v4) in nbformat-schema npm package.
- Include configuration for appveyor's continuous integration service.

4.2.0
-----

`4.2 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestones/4.2>`__

- Update nbformat spec version to 4.2, allowing JSON outputs to have any JSONable type,  not just ``object``,
  and mime-types of the form ``application/anything+json``.
- Define basics of ``authors`` in notebook metadata.
  ``nb.metadata.authors`` shall be a list of objects with the property ``name``, a string of each author's full name.
