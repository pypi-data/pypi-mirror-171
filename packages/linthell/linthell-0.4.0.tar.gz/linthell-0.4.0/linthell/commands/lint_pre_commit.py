    """Linthell with embedded linter executing.

    The purpose of this command is to be the thin wrapper around
    `linthell lint` command, but linter is called inside command. Such behavior
     is required by `pre-commit` hook definition.

    A linter is called in format `<linter-command> <files to proceed separated
    with ' '>`, its return code is ignored. After the output of linter is
    passed to `linthell lint` command alongside with basefile location and lint
    format. The hook requires to pass `--baseline`, `--format` and
    `--linter-command` in `args` section.

    There are two ways to adapt linthell as pre-commit hook:

    1. As python linter: if your linter is python-based (flake8, pydocstyle)
    then you can use default `language` and `entrypoint` configuration of hook.

    2. As system linter: if your linter is not python-based (or requires to be
    installed inside venv of your project like pylint do) then you must set
    `language: system` and
    `entrypoint: <command to launch linthell-pre-commit>`. pre-commit runs
    hooks outside venv, so you should adapt hook config to run the command
    inside it. For example, pylint with poetry as venv manager can be launched
    via `entrypoint: poetry run pylint ...`.
