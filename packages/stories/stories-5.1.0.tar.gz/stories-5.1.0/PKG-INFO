## Pros

- A feature
- B feature
- etc

## Example

A line of text explaining snippet below…

```pycon

>>> from dataclasses import dataclass
>>> from typing import Callable
>>> from stories import Story, I, State
>>> from app.repositories import load_order, load_customer, create_payment

>>> @dataclass
... class Purchase(Story):
...     I.find_order
...     I.find_customer
...     I.check_balance
...     I.persist_payment
...
...     def find_order(self, state):
...         state.order = self.load_order(state.order_id)
...
...     def find_customer(self, state):
...         state.customer = self.load_customer(state.customer_id)
...
...     def check_balance(self, state):
...         if not state.order.affordable_for(state.customer):
...             raise Exception
...
...     def persist_payment(self, state):
...         state.payment = self.create_payment(
...             order_id=state.order_id, customer_id=state.customer_id
...         )
...
...     load_order: Callable
...     load_customer: Callable
...     create_payment: Callable

>>> purchase = Purchase(
...     load_order=load_order,
...     load_customer=load_customer,
...     create_payment=create_payment,
... )

>>> state = State(order_id=1, customer_id=1)

>>> purchase(state)

>>> state  # doctest: +SKIP

>>> state.payment.was_received()
False

```
