Description: # ArgEasy
        
        Argeasy is a *simple and intuitive* command line argument parser for any user, making it easy to build **CLI** applications. With it, you can:
        
        - Set arguments;
        - Set flags;
        - Set application name, description and version;
        - Define the action to be taken when an argument or flag is called.
        
        In addition to having well-structured **user help messages** with all the necessary information. To install this library, use `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install argeasy
        ```
        
        ## Example of use
        
        Here is a simple usage example:
        
        ```python
        import argeasy
        
        parser = argeasy.ArgEasy()
        
        parser.add_argument('foo', 'print foo', action='store_true')
        parser.add_flag('--bar', 'print a text')
        
        args = parser.parse()
        
        if args.foo:
            print('foo')
        ```
        
        In this code, we add an argument called `foo` and set the action (in the `action` argument) to be taken as `store_true`, that is, when this argument is called, its value will be `True`. Otherwise, the value will be `None`.
        
        You can also define information about your application, such as version, description and project name. Do this in the instance of the `ArgEasy` class:
        
        ```python
        argeasy.ArgEasy(
            name='My App',
            description='Description of my App',
            version='1.0.0'
        )
        ```
        
        ### Actions
        
        Action is the action that `argeasy` should take when it perceives an argument. See available actions:
        
        - `default`: get the next argument as a value;
        - `store_true`: if the argument is detected, its value will be `True`;
        - `store_false`: if the argument is detected, its value will be `False`;
        - `append`: if the argument is detected, it will get all other arguments present in front of it.
