class Graph:
    """
    Represents a graph. We keep things very simple - a graph is represented by its sparse adjacency matrix.

    In the general case, this allows for
      - directed and undirected graphs
      - self-loops

    If you'd like to store meta-data about the graph, such as node or edge labels, you should implement a subclass of
    this one, and add that information yourself.

    This graph cannot be dynamically updated. It must be initialised with the complete adjacency matrix.
    Vertices are referred to by their index in the adjacency matrix.
