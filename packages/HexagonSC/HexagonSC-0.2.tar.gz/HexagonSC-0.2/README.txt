This is a program the takes contracts window from printscreen data and interrogates playernames via their citizendata on https://robertsspaceindustries.com/citizens/ 
and prints a table that lists their enlist date and affilated orgs. Supports up to 10 players captured at a time.
Will only scan for "APPREHEND SUSPECT:" missions


The way the table reads is as follows in a repeating pattern:

---------  ----------	...
Playername Enlist date
org 1      org rank 1
org 2      org rank 2
---------  ----------	...
