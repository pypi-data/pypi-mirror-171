    **Combined Heat and Power Organic Rankine Cycle**

            Starting from well production information for a geothermal energy
            reservoir over a lifetime of 40 years, the development of the
            electrical power output of an ORC is monitored within different
            designs of the plant. The geothermal heat source is exploted to
            provide heat to a district heating system and the residual heat is
            used to operate the orc cycle.
