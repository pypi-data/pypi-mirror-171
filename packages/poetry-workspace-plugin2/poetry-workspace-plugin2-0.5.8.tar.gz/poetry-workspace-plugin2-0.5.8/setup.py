To install this preview release, run:\n\n```shell\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python - --preview\n```\n\nInstall this plugin:\n\n```shell\npoetry plugin add poetry-workspace-plugin2\n```\n\n### Why plugin2?\n\nThe [original package](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-workspace-plugin/) was released by [Martin Liu](https://pypi.org/user/martinxsliu/), a former OpenDoor employee. Before he left, he [re-released the project](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-workspace-plugin2/) under the [OpenDoor PyPI account](https://pypi.org/user/opendoor/).\n\n## Workspace\n\nA workspace is a collection of Poetry projects that share a single environment.\n\n## Example config to place at the root\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = "code"\nversion = "0.1.0"\ndescription = "Opendoor Python workspace"\nauthors = ["Developers <developers@opendoor.com>"]\n\n[[tool.poetry.source]]\nname = "pypi-local"\nurl = "https://opendoor.jfrog.io/opendoor/api/pypi/pip/simple"\nsecondary = true\n\n[tool.poetry.workspace]\ninclude = [\n  "lib/**",\n  "workspace/**",\n]\nexclude = [\n  "lib/dev-tools",\n  "lib/legacy",\n  "lib/template/**",\n]\n\n# IMPORTANT: This pyproject.toml file declares dependencies for the shared Python\n# workspace. If your app does not belong to the\n# workspace (i.e. not included in the `include` section above) then do not add your\n# app dependencies here, it will have no effect. Even if your app does belong to\n# the workspace, prefer adding app specific dependencies in your app\'s project.
