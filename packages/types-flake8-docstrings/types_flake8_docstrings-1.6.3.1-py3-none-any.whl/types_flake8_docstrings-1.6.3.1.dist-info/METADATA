## Typing stubs for flake8-docstrings

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `flake8-docstrings` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `flake8-docstrings`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/flake8-docstrings. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `ce4668a1328cfbdccc0137cdf9b9bd5c64120a6c`.
