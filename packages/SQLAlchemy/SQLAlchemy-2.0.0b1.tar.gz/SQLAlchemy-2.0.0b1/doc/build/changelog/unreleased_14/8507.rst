    Fixed regression where using ORM update() with synchronize_session='fetch'
    would fail due to the use of evaluators that are now used to determine the
    in-Python value for expressions in the the SET clause when refreshing
    objects; if the evaluators make use of math operators against non-numeric
    values such as PostgreSQL JSONB, the non-evaluable condition would fail to
    be detected correctly. The evaluator now limits the use of math mutation
    operators to numeric types only, with the exception of "+" that continues
    to work for strings as well. SQLAlchemy 2.0 may alter this further by
    fetching the SET values completely rather than using evaluation.
