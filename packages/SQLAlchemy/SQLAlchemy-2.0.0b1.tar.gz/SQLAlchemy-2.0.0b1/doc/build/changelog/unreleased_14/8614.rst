    The :paramref:`_orm.Session.execute.bind_arguments` dictionary is no longer
    mutated when passed to :meth:`_orm.Session.execute` and similar; instead,
    it's copied to an internal dictionary for state changes. Among other
    things, this fixes and issue where the "clause" passed to the
    :meth:`_orm.Session.get_bind` method would be incorrectly referring to the
    :class:`_sql.Select` construct used for the "fetch" synchronization
    strategy, when the actual query being emitted was a :class:`_dml.Delete` or
    :class:`_dml.Update`. This would interfere with recipes for "routing
    sessions".
