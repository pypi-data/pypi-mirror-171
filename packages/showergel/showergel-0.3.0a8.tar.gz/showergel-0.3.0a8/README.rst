Showergel is made to live aside Liquidsoap_:
while a Liquidsoap script creates a radio stream,
Showergel provides complementary features like playlist logging or occasional
scheduling, with a (minimalist) Web interface.
It is made to run on a Linux box (with systemd) dedicated to your radio stream.

`installation instructions <https://showergel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_
are hosted
on https://showergel.readthedocs.io/.

**This is work in progress!** We'll welcome both contributions
and comments, feel free to start a disucssion in the Issues tab.
