# TIM Python Client

TIM, or Tangent Information Modeler, is Tangent Works’ automatic model building engine. It is designed specifically for time-series forecasting and anomaly detection.

The TIM Python client introduces an easy and fast way to use TIM in any Python project. As an abstraction over [TIM's API](https://tim-platform.tangent.works/api/v5/swagger-ui.html), it encapsulates the logic into useful and performant functions helping users go from time-series data to insights that can generate business value.

The TIM Python client is a Python SDK to use the TIM Engine (v5). This includes methods to:

- upload a dataset,
- update a dataset by uploading a new version,
- delete a dataset,
- retrieve a list of datasets,
- retrieve a list of dataset versions,
- create a forecasting build model job,
- execute a forecasting job,
- create and execute a forecasting build model job,
- create a forecasting predict job
- create and execute a forecasting predict job,
- create a forecasting rebuild model job,
- create and execute a forecasting rebuild model job,
- retrieve the results of a forecasting job,
- retrieve a list of forecasting jobs,
- delete a forecasting job,
- create an anomaly detection build model job,
- execute an anomaly detection job,
- create and execute an anomaly detection build model job,
- create an anomaly detection detect job,
- create and execute an anomaly detection detect job,
- create an anomaly detection rebuild model job,
- created and execute an anomaly detection rebuild model job,
- retrieve the results of an anomaly detection job,
- retrieve a list of anomaly detection jobs,
- delete an anomaly detection job,
- retrieve a list of workspaces.
