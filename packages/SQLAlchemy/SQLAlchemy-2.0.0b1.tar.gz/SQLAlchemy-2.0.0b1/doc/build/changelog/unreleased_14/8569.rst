    Fixed regression for 1.4 in :func:`_orm.contains_eager` where the "wrap in
    subquery" logic of :func:`_orm.joinedload` would be inadvertently triggered
    for use of the :func:`_orm.contains_eager` function with similar statements
    (e.g. those that use ``distinct()``, ``limit()`` or ``offset()``), which
    would then lead to secondary issues with queries that used some
    combinations of SQL label names and aliasing. This "wrapping" is not
    appropriate for :func:`_orm.contains_eager` which has always had the
    contract that the user-defined SQL statement is unmodified with the
    exception of adding the appropriate columns to be fetched.
