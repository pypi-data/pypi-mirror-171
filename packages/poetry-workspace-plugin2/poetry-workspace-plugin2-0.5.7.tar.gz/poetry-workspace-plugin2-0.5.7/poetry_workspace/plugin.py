    Normally if a workspace project's dependencies are changed, then the workspace
    will resolve the changed dependencies if an update operation was performed for
    the workspace project (e.g. `poetry lock`, `poetry update`, or `poetry update
    foo`). If an update operation was not performed (e.g. `poetry lock --no-update`,
    or `poetry update not-foo`) then the changed dependencies will not be resolved.

    We want to resolve workspace project dependencies all the time as if they are
    direct dependencies of the workspace root project, regardless of whether an
    update was performed or not. This method monkey patches the `VersionSolver` class
    so that all workspace projects are included in the `use_latest` list to ensure
    that the resolver always uses the latest version of workspace projects.
