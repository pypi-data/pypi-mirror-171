                      This package can be used to classify associates on their performance of total fulfiled and total unfulfiled with
                      two different groups.

                      In easy words let's say we want to see performance (good and bad) salesman for urban market, 
                      rural market, and here we can use this package by passing a dataframe, column name of salesman id, 
                      column name of saleflag (indicating 0 for unsold and 1 for sold), column name of grouping column 
                      (having only two unique values or levels).
                      
                      By default,
                      by calling the result() method after creating object we can get the Top 30 percentage and Bottom 30 percentage salesman.

                      We can change this top and bottom percentage by passing argument (e.g. n=20) inside this result() method.
                      By default this percentage is set to 30%, i.e. n=30 is default argument.
