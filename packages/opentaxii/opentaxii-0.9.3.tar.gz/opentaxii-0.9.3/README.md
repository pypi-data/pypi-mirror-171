## State of the project

We have made the decision to consider this project **feature-complete**. It means we still maintain it, however we focus only on bug fixes. Still, weâ€™re very open to external contributions - if you know how to fix an issue and you can open a PR, we will be very grateful.

## Getting started

## Getting started with OpenTAXII using Docker

OpenTAXII can also be run using docker. This guide assumes that you have
access to a local or remote docker server, and won't go into the setup
of docker.

To get a default (development) instance using docker

```bash

> locally in a SQLite databases optionally using services/collections/accounts defined
> in [data-configuration.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EclecticIQ/OpenTAXII/master/examples/data-configuration.yml)
