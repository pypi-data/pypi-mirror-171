# GmailValidChecker
Gmail validity checker

## Description

The program will return only two results:

- `Alive`: means that everything is fine with this Gmail and is being used.
- `Unregistered`: It means that the Gmail is not registered or is **blocked**.

**You must be aware that an `Unregistered` status does not mean that you are truly unregistered. The program cannot determine whether Gmail is unregistered or blocked.**

## Usage
1. You need to install `GmailChecker` before.
```bash
pip install GmailChecker
```
2. Create a new `.py` file with the following codes.
```python
from GmailChecker import GmailChecker
GmailChecker.verify("admin@gmail.com")
```
3. If you want to sweep Gmails in bulk, you can use the following codes.
```python
from GmailChecker import GmailChecker
for i in range(1000000, 9999999):
    email = str(i) + '@gmail.com'
    GmailChecker.verify(email)
```
