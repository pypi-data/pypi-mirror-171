# KubeMo

KubeMo aims to simplify ML model deployment by aggregating as many machine-learning frameworks as possible into unified APIs along with the help of cloud-native toolkits.

**From PyPi**

KubeMo has been published to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), so you can install it simply by using pip.

```
pip install kubemo
```

Note that KubeMo is not ready for production until the first stable release, so you can eithor wait or help us reach the day earlier :)
