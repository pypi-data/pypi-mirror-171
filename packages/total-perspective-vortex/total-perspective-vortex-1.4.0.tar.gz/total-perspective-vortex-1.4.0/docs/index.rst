   **Dynamic rules for routing Galaxy entities to destinations**

TotalPerspectiveVortex (TPV) provides an installable set of dynamic rules for the
`Galaxy application`_ that can route entities (Tools, Users, Roles) to appropriate
destinations based on a configurable yaml file. The aim of TPV is to build on and
unify previous efforts, such as `Dynamic Tool Destinations`_, the `Job Router`_ and
`Sorting Hat`_, into a configurable set of rules that that can be extended arbitrarily
with custom Python logic.

How it works
------------
TPV provides a dynamic rule that can be plugged into Galaxy via ``job_conf.xml``.
The dynamic rule will also have an associated configuration file, that maps entities
(tools, users, roles) to specific destination through a flexible tagging system.
Destinations can have arbitrary tags defined, and each entity can express a preference
or aversion to specific tags. Based on this tagging, jobs are routed to the most appropriate
destination. In addition, admins can also plugin arbitrary python based rules for making
more complex decisions, as well as custom ranking functions for choosing between matching
destinations. For example, a ranking function could query influx metrics to determine
the least loaded destination, and route jobs there, providing a basic form of
"metascheduling" functionality.

Shared database
---------------

A shared database of TPV rules are maintained in: https://github.com/galaxyproject/tpv-shared-database/
These rules are based on typical settings used in the usegalaxy.* federation, which you can override
based on local resource availability.

Getting Started
---------------

1. `pip install total-perspective-vortex` into Galaxy's python virtual environment
2. Configure Galaxy to use TPV's dynamic destination rule
3. Create the TPV job mapping yaml file, indicating job routing preferences
4. Submit jobs as usual
