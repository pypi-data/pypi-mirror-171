# The script element allows staging elements into specific locations
# via it's "location" dependency configuration
#
# For example, if you want to stage "foo-tools.bst" into the "/" of
# the sandbox at buildtime, and the "foo-system.bst" element into
# the %{build-root}, you can do so as follows:
#
# build-depends:
# - foo-tools.bst
# - filename: foo-system.bst
#   config:
#     location: "%{build-root}"
#
# Note: the default of the "location" parameter is "/", so it is not
#       necessary to specify the location if you want to stage the
#       element in "/"
#

# Common script element variables

  # Defines the directory commands will be run from.

  # Defines whether to run the sandbox with '/' read-only.
  # It is recommended to set root as read-only wherever possible.
