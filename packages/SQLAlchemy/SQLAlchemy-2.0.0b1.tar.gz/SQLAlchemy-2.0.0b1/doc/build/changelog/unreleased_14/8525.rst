    Fixed yet another regression in SQL Server isolation level fetch (see
    :ticket:`8231`, :ticket:`8475`), this time with "Microsoft Dynamics CRM
    Database via Azure Active Directory", which apparently lacks the
    ``system_views`` view entirely. Error catching has been extended that under
    no circumstances will this method ever fail, provided database connectivity
    is present.
